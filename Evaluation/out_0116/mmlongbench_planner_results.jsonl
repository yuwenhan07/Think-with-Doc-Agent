in the coming year—twice the rate of other groups.\n\n- **Figure: “Latinos lag behind U.S. public on income and wealth and have higher poverty rates”** shows that from 2000 to 2014, Hispanic real median household income ($42,500) trailed all households ($53,700), Hispanic poverty rate (23.6%) was significantly higher than the national rate (14.8%), and Hispanic median net worth ($13,700 in 2013) was much lower than all households ($81,400 in 2013).\n\n- Shaded areas in the figure denote recessions (2001 and 2007–2009), and data lines break after 2013 due to a redesign of the income question.\n\n- Economic issues, including education, jobs, and the economy, are top priorities for Hispanic registered voters, ranking above health care and immigration in 2014.\n\n- Hispanics are more supportive of raising the minimum wage (84%) than the general U.S. public (73%), according to the same December 2015 Pew survey.\n\n- Data sources: U.S. Census Bureau (income and poverty), Pew
