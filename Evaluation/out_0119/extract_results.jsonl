The core problem is to define the term 'directive fine-tuning' specifically within the context of white-box models and how it relates to knowledge integration. To address this, one must first understand directive fine-tuning as a method that uses explicit instructions or directives to guide model behavior during fine-tuning. White-box models refer to models whose internal mechanisms are transparent and modifiable, which allows for precise control during fine-tuning.

Directive fine-tuning involves providing structured, explicit instructions (e.g., in natural language or formal logic) during training to steer the model toward desired behaviors. These directives can encode external knowledge, such as domain-specific rules or factual data.

This spatial arrangement is critical in understanding the airflow and fuel delivery dynamics. The throttle valve typically controls air intake, while the fuel injector delivers fuel into the intake stream. In modern engines, especially those with port fuel injection, the throttle valve is often located in the intake manifold, upstream of the fuel injectors. However, in some direct injection systems, the injector is located in the combustion chamber, making the 'directly below' relationship less applicable. Therefore, the most likely system is the intake manifold system, where the throttle body is positioned before the injectors. A diagram would show the throttle body at the entrance of the intake manifold, with injectors mounted on the manifold runners, downstream of the throttle. The spatial arrangement is linear: air enters through the throttle body, then flows through the manifold runners to the injectors before reaching the intake valves.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Where in the engine is the throttle valve situated relative to the fuel injector, and how is this configuration arranged spatially?\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"The core issue is the spatial relationship between the throttle valve and fuel injector. In most gasoline engines with port fuel injection, the throttle valve is located in the throttle body, which is part of the intake system. The fuel injectors are mounted on the intake manifold runners, downstream of the throttle body. Thus, the throttle valve is not directly 'below' the injector in a vertical sense, but rather upstream in the airflow path. The term 'directly below' may imply a vertical alignment, which is uncommon in standard engine designs. However, in some compact or specialized engine layouts, such as in certain inline or V-type engines with vertical intake manifolds, the throttle body may be positioned vertically above the injectors. In such cases, the throttle valve would be directly above, not below. Therefore, the query may be based on a misinterpretation of spatial orientation. A correct description would clarify that the throttle valve is upstream of the injector in the intake airflow path, and diagrams would show the throttle body connected to the intake manifold, with injectors located in the runners leading to the cylinder head.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Can you identify the engine subsystem where the"}

In diesel engines, power is controlled by varying the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder, while air intake remains unrestricted. This is possible because diesel engines rely on compression ignition and do not need a precise air-fuel mixture like gasoline engines. In some GDI engines, variable valve timing or lift allows control of airflow without a throttle, enabling more efficient operation.
