            "text": "In this paper, we introduced MemGPT, a novel LLM system inspired by operating systems to manage the limited context windows of large language models. By designing a memory hierarchy and control flow analogous to traditional OSes, MemGPT provides the illusion of larger context resources for LLMs. This OS-inspired approach was evaluated in two domains where existing LLM performance is constrained by finite context lengths: document analysis and conversational agents. For document analysis, MemGPT could process lengthy texts well beyond the context limits of current LLMs by effectively paging relevant context in and out of memory. For conversational agents, MemGPT enabled maintaining long-term memory, consistency, and evolvability over extended dialogues. Overall, MemGPT demonstrates that operating system techniques like hierarchical memory management and interrupts can unlock the potential of LLMs even when constrained by fixed context lengths."

By designing a memory hierarchy and control flow analogous to traditional OSes, MemGPT provides the illusion of larger context resources for LLMs. This OS-inspired approach was evaluated in two domains where existing LLM performance is constrained by finite context lengths: document analysis and conversational agents. For document analysis, MemGPT could process lengthy texts well beyond the context limits of current LLMs by effectively paging relevant context in and out of memory. For conversational agents, MemGPT enabled maintaining long-term memory, consistency, and evolvability over extended dialogues.

Working context is a fixed-size read/write block of unstructured text, writeable only via MemGPT function calls. In conversational settings, working context is intended to be used to store key facts, preferences, and other important information about the user and the persona the agent is adopting, allowing the agent to converse fluently with the user. The FIFO queue stores a rolling history of messages, including messages between the agent and user, as well as system messages (e.g. memory warnings) and function call inputs and outputs. The first index in the FIFO queue stores a system message containing a recursive summary of messages that have been evicted from the queue."

Nakano et al. (2021) train models to search the web before answering questions, and use similar pagination concepts to MemGPT to control the underlying context size in their web-browsing environment. Yao et al. (2022) showed that interleaving chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) can further improve the planning ability of interactive LLM-based agents; similarly in MemGPT, LLM is able to “plan out loud” when executing functions. Liu et al. (2023b) introduced a suite of LLM-as-an-agent benchmarks to evaluate LLMs in interactive environments, including video games, thinking puzzles, and web shopping. In contrast, our work focuses on tackling the problem of equipping agents with long-term memory of user inputs."

By designing a memory hierarchy and control flow analogous to traditional OSes, MemGPT provides the illusion of larger context resources for LLMs. This OS-inspired approach was evaluated in two domains where existing LLM performance is constrained by finite context lengths: document analysis and conversational agents. For document analysis, MemGPT could process lengthy texts well beyond the context limits of current LLMs by effectively paging relevant context in and out of memory. For conversational agents, MemGPT enabled maintaining long-term memory, consistency, and evolvability over extended dialogues. Overall, MemGPT demonstrates that operating system techniques like hierarchical memory management and interrupts can unlock the potential of LLMs even when constrained by fixed context lengths."

The LLM completion tokens (outputs) are interpreted as function calls by the function executor. MemGPT uses functions to move data between main context and *external context* (the archival and recall storage databases).

Nakano et al. (2021) train models to search the web before answering questions, and use similar pagination concepts to MemGPT to control the underlying context size in their web-browsing environment. Yao et al. (2022) showed that interleaving chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) can further improve the planning ability of interactive LLM-based agents; similarly in MemGPT, LLM is able to “plan out loud” when executing functions. Liu et al. (2023b) introduced a suite of LLM-as-an-agent benchmarks to evaluate LLMs in interactive environments, including video games, thinking puzzles, and web shopping. In contrast, our work focuses on tackling the problem of equipping agents with long-term memory of user inputs."

We precompute embeddings and load them into the database, which uses an HNSW index to enable approximate, sub-second query times. In MemGPT, the entire embedding document set is loaded into archival storage, and the retriever naturally emerges via the archival storage search functionality (which performs vector search based on cosine similarity). In the fixed-context baselines, the top-$K$ documents are fetched using the retriever independently from the LLM inference, similar to the original retriever-reader setup in Liu et al. (2023a)."
